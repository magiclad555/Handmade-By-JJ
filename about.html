    <h2>Crafting hands help heal grieving hearts with crochet and resin work</h2>

    <br>
I started crocheting when I was pregnant with my 2nd child. I made her a blanket to which she still has. My youngest goes to bed with his crochet blanket every night. My inspiration is them, they try all my items.
<br><br>

My range for crocheting is limitless, I have yet to find a pattern that I can't succeed with. Although my passion will always be crocheting, I have always wanted to try working with resin. I started small, the letter keyrings kept me busy for a while. 
I then tried other items. I fell in love with it.
My husband even sorted me a craft room as my obsession grew.<br><br>

In January 2023, tradegy struck the family. My brother passed away very suddenly at the young age of 43. It broke me in half, I didn't want to get out of bed for a long while. Although it was working with resin that helped. 
My family wanted something to remember him by, but with the cost of the funeral, we couldn't afford much. 
So I tried adding his ashes to the resin. It was so hard opening that box for the first time. I spoke with him throughout and was fine until white wedding played on the radio "hey little sister what have you done" blarring out.

I have given each member of the family a heart, a keyring and a pot for his ashes. Which they all loved. Ben had a massive heart and helped so many people.
<br><br>

So I thought I would continue this love and create resin items for others at a reasonable price. I want to keep the price down as much as possible. I can make many different items. Bespoke items can be requested.
